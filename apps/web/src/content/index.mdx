# Introduction

> Usefull UI components that can be added directly in your project codebase.

Util UI is a registry of reusable components based on a Design System that you can add directly into your codebase.

The components are compatible with [shadcn ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and its [cli](/docs/cli).

It follows a similar philosphy, giving you control over the components code so that you can use them how you wish and customize them however you want.
